However, this increases dataset size, so monitor memory usage.\n\n7. **Cross-Validation**:\n   - Use `nfolds = 5` for robust model evaluation. Avoid `nfolds = 0` unless a validation frame is provided.\n\n8. **Seed for Reproducibility**:\n   - Set `seed = 123` (or any fixed integer) to ensure reproducibility of results.\n\n9. **Include Key Algorithms**:\n   - Ensure `include_algos = ['XGBoost', 'GBM', 'DRF', 'GLM']` to focus on high-performing algorithms for tabular data.\n\n10. **Monitor Training Progress**:\n    - Use `verbosity = 'info'` to get detailed logs during training, helping debug or optimize further.\n\n**Example Code Snippet**:\n```python\naml = H2OAutoML(\n    max_runtime_secs=60,\n    exclude_algos=['DeepLearning'],\n    sort_metric='AUC',\n    stopping_metric='AUC',\n    stopping_rounds=3,\n    nfolds=5,\n    seed=123,\n    include_algos=['XGBoost', 'GBM', 'DRF', 'GLM'],\n    verbosity='info'\n)\naml.train(x=x, y='Churn', training_frame=train)\n```\n\nThese steps ensure the AutoML process is optimized for accuracy, adheres to user constraints, and leverages the strengths of H2O’s algorithms for classification tasks."
